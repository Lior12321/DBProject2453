# ðŸŽ“ University Database Management System â€“ DBProject2453

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This project simulates a university database system. It contains key entities such as **students, professors, departments, courses, grades, enrollments, and classrooms**, and defines logical relationships among them using SQL.
The goal is to build a well-structured, normalized relational database and demonstrate meaningful queries and operations on it.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Design a normalized relational database.
- Create and manage tables with correct relationships using primary and foreign keys.
- Execute complex SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate data.
- Ensure data integrity and prevent anomalies.
- Practice ERD modeling and real-world academic data management.

## ðŸ§± Technologies Used

- PostgreSQL
- SQL (DDL, DML)
- Python *(optional - if applicable)*
- CSV data (via Mockaroo)
- Diagram tools like ERD+ (for ERD & DSD creation)

## ðŸ›  How to Run

1. **Create tables:**
   ```sql
   \i createTables.sql
   ```

2. **Insert data:**
   ```sql
   \i insertTables.sql
   ```

3. **Run queries:**
   ```sql
   \i selectAll.sql
   ```

4. *(Optional)* Run Python scripts for automated interaction with the database:
   ```bash
   python Programming/source.py
   ```

## ðŸ“Š Project Highlights

- Clear ERD model using separate tables for complex many-to-many relationships (Enrollments, Grades).
- Proper use of foreign keys and constraints to ensure referential integrity.
- `UNIQUE` constraints for email fields to avoid duplication.
- Support for future scalability (e.g., attendance tracking, repeated course attempts, notifications).
- Clean separation of academic entities and infrastructure (e.g., courses vs. classrooms).
